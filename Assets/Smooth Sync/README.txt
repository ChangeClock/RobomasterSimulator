Plugin Version: 3.41

# Smooth Sync
Performs interpolation and extrapolation in order to make your objects smooth and more accurate over the network.
Highly configurable, only send what you need. Optionally compress floats to further reduce bandwidth. 
Customizable interpolation and extrapolation settings depending on your game's needs.
Comes with a fully functional example scene.
The full source code is provided so you can see everything with detailed comments!

Supports Windows, OSX, Linux, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo. If Unity runs it, it'll run!

## Installation
After importing Smooth Sync, extract the included package for your networking system.
For example if you're using Mirror, extract the SmoothSyncMirror.unitypackage
If you update Smooth Sync, remember to re-extract the package as well.

## UNet / Mirror / MLAPI
## Step 1 - Drag and Drop

1. Put the SmoothSync script onto any parent networked object that you want to be smoother. 
2. It will automatically sync the object it is on. 
     *In order to sync a child object, you must have two instances of 
   SmoothSync on the parent. Set childObjectToSync on one of them to point to the child you want to sync, and leave 
   it blank on the other one to sync the parent. You cannot sync children without syncing the parent.
3. It is now smoothy synced across the network. 

## PUN and PUN2
## Step 1 - Drag and Drop

1. Put the SmoothSync script onto any networked object that you want to be smoother. 
2. Drag the object's Smooth Sync component to the Photon View's Observed Components. 
3. It is now smoothy synced across the network. 
4. This applies to children as well, each child should have their own Photon View and Smooth Sync component.

## Step 2 - Tweak to Your Needs

Now that it is on your networked object:

1. Read the tooltips corresponding to the variables to tweak the smoothness to your game's
specific needs. More detailed comments are in the code comments for the variables. 
2. Reduce your bandwidth by only sending position, rotation, and velocity variables that you need.


# How it Works

Unlike the NetworkTransform script provided by Unity, the SmoothSync script stores a list of network States to interpolate 
between. This allows for a more accurate and smoother representation of synced objects.

# Methods you may need

Check out SmoothSyncExamplePlayerController.cs and SmoothSyncExample.unity for implementations and further explanation of these:

SmoothSync.teleport() - Used to teleport your objects for situations like respawning so that they don't interpolate.
SmoothSync.forceStateSendNextFixedUpdate() - Useful if you have a low send rate but you want to manually send a transform
in between the send rate. 
SmoothSync.clearBuffer() - You will need to manually call this on all of the object's instances if you change the object's network owner.
Alternatively, check Smooth Authority Changes to use an extra byte and handle it automatically and smoothly.
SmoothSync.validateStateMethod - You may set up a validation method to check incoming States to see if cheating may be happening.
